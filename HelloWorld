The following is a Hello World program written in the Java programming language. What do you think it does?

public class HelloWorld
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}

Have a close look at it. What questions does it make you think of? Is there anything that is confusing? What parts can you understand, if any?

Make a note of any questions that arise so you can ask your teacher.
